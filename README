= client_date plugin for Ruby on Rails

The client_date Ruby on Rails plugin uses client-side Javascript
to format a date/time in a view instead of the server. The client
is given UTC time for formatting so the server doesn't have to
store which time zone each user is in.

== Installation

  It looks like Rails 2.1 will support "script/plugin install" with Git
  repositories.  Until then you can put this plugin in vendor/plugins with:

  git clone git://github.com/ryanlowe/client_date.git

  and delete the .git directory inside it before committing it to source control.

  When Rails 2.1 supports Git you should be able to do:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/ryanlowe/client_date.git

== Setup

  First include the ClientDate mixin in your ApplicationHelper.

    module ApplicationHelper
      include ClientDate
      ...
    end

  Then copy the javascript code in javascripts/client_date.js to
  your project.  You can do this two ways:

  1. Copy client_date.js to your javascripts/ directory and
     add it to your Rails project using javascript_include_tag.
  2. Copy the code in client_date.js to javascripts/application.js
     which is pulled in by javascript_include_tag :defaults.

== Usage

  In a view you can use these two:
  
  # month, day
  format_date(date)  
  
  # month, day, hour, minute
  format_datetime(date)
  
  The date parameter should be a normal Ruby date, like the "datetime" used
  in Rails migrations.
  
  Example:
  
  Created at: <%= format_datetime(post.created_at) %><br/>
  
== Customization

  Change how client_date formats dates and datetimes by changing the
  fd() and fdt() Javascript functions.
